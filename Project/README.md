Final Project for the course
--Task--
  "Implement part of an operating system that does CPU job (process) scheduling (P.9.57).
  This requires reading an input stream of incoming jobs (processes), their relative priorities, and amount of time
  required for the CPU to process them. Analysis should include varying input workloads (i.e. a lot of processes
  starting at roughly the same time) and the effect of having more than one CPU to execute processes (i.e. more
  than one queue server)."
